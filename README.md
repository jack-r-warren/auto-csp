More information is available on [my website's page for this project](https://jackwarren.info/posts/projects/auto-csp).

### Running
Java 14 is needed for building:

```text
./gradlew build
```

To run the application with the automated browser, Chrome or Firefox with their associated [WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/) binary must be available on your system path. Chrome is the default but Firefox can be used instead with a command line flag.

Running is easiest done using the `jar` generated by the `build` task, at `core/build/libs/core-X.Y.Z-all.jar`. There is command-line documentation available with the `-h` flag (the flag can be applied to subcommands too to see their options).
